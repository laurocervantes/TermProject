## SOFTWARE DESCRIPTION
<div align="justify"> 
The main purpose of this Web Application is to prove the usage of HTML and CSS manipulation and the integration with Vue.js framework, while keeping the elements 
of the site decoupled. With that said, only two html files were used for the creation of this project and they were structured into big sections, to be able to
utilize the scrolling option for accessing the website on a modern way. The Vue components are fetching API calls from the internet and the Contact Me form is
connected to a real time database called Firebase.
